Your app manages online gift cards for a soon-to-be-major e-tailer.
Customers can use the app to place orders using their card
balance.  
  
We have classes that model the GiftCard and the Customer.  Your task
is to write a test suite for them.
  
In this question, construct tests that verify:
* a GiftCard when first created has a non-negative cash balance
* a GiftCard when first created assigns itself a balance
---
</markdown>
<!-- 
* a withdrawal when there is enough cash returns success, and changes 
the card balance <br />
* a withdrawal when there is not enough cash returns failure, provides 
an error message explaining the failure, and does not change the card balance. <br />
