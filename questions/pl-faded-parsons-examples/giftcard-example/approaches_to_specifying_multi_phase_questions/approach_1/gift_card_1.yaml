  Your app manages online gift cards for a soon-to-be-major e-tailer.
  Customers can use the app to place orders using their card
  balance. 

  We have classes that model the GiftCard and the Customer.  First you
  will write tests for the GiftCard class, to verify that:

  * a GiftCard when first created has a non-negative cash balance
  * a withdrawal when there is enough cash returns success, and changes
  the card balance
  * a withdrawal when there is not enough cash returns failure, provides
  an error message explaining the failure, and does not change the card balance.
  
solution:
  pre: |
    describe GiftCard do
  lines: | 
      it 'fails with negative balance' do
        expect { GiftCard.new(-1) }.to raise_error(ArgumentError)
      end
      it 'succeeds with positive balance' do
        gift_card = GiftCard.new(20)
        expect(gift_card.balance).to eq(20)
      end
