Your app manages online gift cards for a soon-to-be-major e-tailer.
Customers can use the app to place orders using their card
balance. <br /><br />

We have classes that model the GiftCard and the Customer.  First you
wrote tests for the creation of a new GiftCard. Now you will add tests
for the withdraw method shown below to verify that: <br /><br />

* a withdrawal when there is enough cash returns success, and changes
the card balance <br />
* a withdrawal when there is not enough cash returns failure, provides 
an error message explaining the failure, and does not change the card balance. <br /><br />

System Under Test:
<pl-code language="ruby">
class GiftCard
  attr_reader :balance, :error
  def initialize(balance)
    if balance < 0
      raise ArgumentError.new("New gift card cannot have negative balance")
    end
    @balance = balance
    @error = nil
  end
  def withdraw(amount)
    if @balance >= amount
      @balance -= amount
    else
      @error = "Insufficient balance"
    end
  end
end
</pl-code>

The provided code before the submission box is semantically equivalent to the 
code you wrote previously, but take note that we have chosen to separate it 
logically by putting it into a `describe` block.
