    Your app manages online gift cards for a soon-to-be-major e-tailer.
    Customers can use the app to place orders using their card
    balance. <br /><br />
    
    We have classes that model the GiftCard and the Customer.  First you
    will write tests for the GiftCard class, to verify that: <br /><br />
    
    * a GiftCard when first created has a non-negative cash balance <br />
    * a withdrawal when there is enough cash returns success, and changes 
    the card balance <br />
    * a withdrawal when there is not enough cash returns failure, provides 
    an error message explaining the failure, and does not change the card balance. <br />


    Name your tests as follows to recieve autograder feedback:
    <pl-code language="rb">'GiftCard fails with negative balance'
'GiftCard succeeds with positive balance'</pl-code>
