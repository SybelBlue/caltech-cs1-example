Your app manages online gift cards for a soon-to-be-major e-tailer.
Customers can use the app to place orders using their card
balance.  
  
We have classes that model the GiftCard and the Customer.  Your task
is to write a test suite for them.
  
In this question, construct tests that verify:
* a GiftCard when first created has a non-negative cash balance
* a GiftCard when first created assigns itself a balance

For autograder feedback (and to receive points to progress), make sure your tests are named as follows:
```ruby
'GiftCard fails to instantiate with negative balance'
'GiftCard successfully assigns a positive balance on instantiation'
```
