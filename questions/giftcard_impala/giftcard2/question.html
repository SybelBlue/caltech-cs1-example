Your app manages online gift cards for a soon-to-be-major e-tailer.
Customers can use the app to place orders using their card
balance. <br /><br />

We have classes that model the GiftCard and the Customer.  First you
will write tests for the GiftCard class, to verify that: <br /><br />

* a GiftCard when first created has a non-negative cash balance <br />
* a withdrawal when there is enough cash returns success, and changes
the card balance <br />
* a withdrawal when there is not enough cash returns failure, provides 
an error message explaining the failure, and does not change the card balance. <br /><br />

The provided code is semantically equivalent to the 
code you wrote previously, but take note that we have chosen to separate it 
logically by putting it into a `describe` block.
