In this question, construct tests that verify:
* a withdrawal when there is enough balance returns success
* a withdrawal when there is enough balance changes the card balance
* a withdrawal when there is enough balance does not produce an error message
  
The provided code that goes before yours is semantically equivalent to the 
code you wrote previously, but take note that we have chosen to separate it 
logically by putting it into a `describe` block.  

For autograder feedback (and to recieve points to progress), make sure your tests are named as follows:
```ruby
'GiftCard withdrawing with sufficient balance returns a truthy value'
'GiftCard withdrawing with sufficient balance changes the balance'
'GiftCard withdrawing with sufficient balance does not result in error message'
```
