  In this question, construct tests that verify:
  * a withdrawal when there is enough balance returns success
  * a withdrawal when there is enough balance changes the card balance
  * a withdrawal when there is enough balance does not produce an error message
    
  The provided code that goes before yours is semantically equivalent to the 
  code you wrote previously, but take note that we have chosen to separate it 
  logically by putting it into a `describe` block.
